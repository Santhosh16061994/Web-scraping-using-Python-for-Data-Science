# Web-scraping-using-Python-for-Data-Science


Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites by programmatically retrieving and parsing HTML pages. Python is a popular language for web scraping due to its powerful libraries and tools, such as BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Scrapy.

Here you will find  simple example of how to perform web scraping using Python and BeautifulSoup:

This code in the notes performs web scraping on the Wikipedia page listing the countries by population, using the Requests library to make a GET request and the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content. It finds the table containing the population data by its class name, extracts the data from the table rows and columns, and prints the name and population of each country.

It's important to note that web scraping may be restricted or prohibited by websites' terms of service or by law in some cases. It's also important to respect website owners' requests to limit or stop web scraping, and to ensure that the scraping is done in a responsible and ethical manner.
